# I.N.S.P.I.R.E. Bus Poll System

## Project Overview
The **I.N.S.P.I.R.E. Bus Poll System** is a web-based application that allows users to participate in a time-based poll to determine the most convenient bus departure time. Users can select their preferred departure time from the available options, and once they submit their choice, they receive a token (or ticket). The token includes the date and time of submission as well as the chosen departure time, and users are required to carry a screenshot of the token for verification.

### Key Features:
- Poll system with various bus departure time options.
- Time-limited polls for user participation.
- Token generation upon submission with details of choice and timestamp.
- Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.
